Ryli Davis' Portfolio

My portfolio was created with my thorough skillset of express, node.js, and combined with the usage of pug templates. Each project contains a unique application designed with various technologies.

My application is able to run directly from the command line by running 'npm start'. I customized the design by using different colors, background colors, and box or text shadows as follows -

.portfolio-intro p - olive font color
.sidebar a - white font color
.box - white font color
.projects-box h5 - middle grey font color
.about-intro-box p - white font color
.project-info-box p - white font color
.sidebar - dark olive background color
.body - dark olive background color
.box - added background image; 
background-size: 1200px 1000px;
max-width: 1065px;
margin-bottom: 15px;
border: 4px solid #fff;
box-shadow: 0 0 0 1px rgba(10, 10, 10, 0.2);
color: #fff
